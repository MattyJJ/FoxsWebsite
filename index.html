    <p>
        I am a programmer/developer, primarily working on bots for Discord under the name The Fox Online.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently working on a Discord bot that is still in development and hasn't been fully tested. If you'd like to test this bot on Discord, you can either create a new server or add it to an existing one.

    <p>
        The languages I code in are HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
    </p>

    <p>
        I plan to learn Java in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to message me on Discord if you have suggestions for features to add to my bot.
